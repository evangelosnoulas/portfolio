                <h3> Performance Management-Metro Deutschland</h3>
                <p>For the course “Performance Management”, we took over a project where me and my team collaborated
                    (unofficially) with Metro Deutschland to work on a challenge relevant to their performance
                    management system. Specifically, the challenge was about poor communication of the goals from
                    managers to the lower-level employees. Thus, employees had an unclear image of the tasks required
                    from them and managers did not have clear KPIs to evaluate employees’ performance. In this project,
                    me and my team, after an interview with the head of Metro’s HR department, we wrote a consultancy
                    report to analyze the situation and provide Metro’s HR manager with clear advice to tackle this
                    problem.</p>

                <h3>Recruitment & Selection-Redesign of AVIs</h3>
                <p>In the course Recruitment and Selection, we were given the opportunity to redesign the tool of
                    Asynchronous Video Interviews to enhance its validity and to eliminate potential discrimination from
                    the tool against minority groups. After a thorough examination of the existing literature, we came
                    up with specific advise for the achievement of these two goals and then, we presented our paper to a
                    recruiter from NS, the Dutch railways company. </p>

                <h3>Talent Development & Analytics – Coolblue</h3>
                <p> For the course “Talent Development and Analytics”, me and my team did a group project with Coolblue
                    as a part of an official collaboration. The goal of this project was to write a consultancy report
                    for Coolblue, on how it can restructure its offices to facilitate transition from home office to the
                    real office after Covid-19, so that employees can feel safe, physically and mentally well, motivated
                    and engaged. Furthermore, another part of the challenge was to assist Coolblue’s employees to combat
                    professional isolation during Covidd-19 pandemic. During the whole project, we had several meetings
                    with employees from Coolblue, to understand better the culture of the company, their aspirations and
                    to discuss about our ideas and progress. Our assignment was awarded the 2nd position and was graded
                    with an 8. </p>

                <h3>Talent Development and Analytics - Management advisory report</h3>
                <p> Also, for the course “Talent Development and Analytics”, I did an individual assignment where I
                    compared fictitious data in excel from 4 training programs to find which would be the most effective
                    and with the best Return of Investment. All these trainings were presented in a management advisory
                    report for Tesla (as a fictitious case) to develop its employees’ performance on its call center.
                    This assignment was awarded a grade of 8,3.</p>

                <h3>Master’s Thesis</h3>
                <p>The Master’s Thesis project was one of the most challenging and at the same time, interesting things
                    that I have done during my studies. It was a valuable experience because I learnt how to build a
                    research project from scratch, how to overcome problems that may arise, deal with setbacks and be
                    more persistent. Also, I was in charge of managing everything relevant to the project such as time
                    management, find a company and conducting interviews with its employees. I wrote a qualitative
                    thesis on Human Energy at work and specifically on “how do employees manage and sustain their energy
                    in a high-pressure work context”. </p>
